# Helpful DOM

Provides a basic set of javascript functions and classes that are not a part of the basic DOM api.

This package is ONLY meant to be used by browsers and not node as methods and extensions found in this package include
potential system access that node does not have, unlike @zthun/helpful-fn, where methods are supported on both node apps
and browsers.

## Installation

```sh
# NPM
npm install @zthun/helpful-dom
# Yarn
yarn add @zthun/helpful-dom
```
