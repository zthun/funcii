# Helpful Brands

This package contains an object structure and a builder for different brands. The current list of supported brands are a
subset of those found in [Font Awesome's Brand Family](https://fontawesome.com/search?o=r&m=free&f=brands).

This package is mostly used for demos and testing of UI components.

## Installation

```sh
# NPM
npm install @zthun/helpful-brands --save-dev
# Yarn
yarn add @zthun/helpful-brands --dev
```

## Usage

Usage of this library mostly revolves around the brand interface and the builder that accompanies it.

```ts
import { IZBrand, ZBrandBuilder } from '@zthun/helpful-brands';

// Constructs a new brand with a given id and name.
const brand: IZBrand = new ZBrandBuilder()
  .id('facebook')
  .name('Facebook')
  .founded(2004)
  .owner('Meta Platforms')
  .build();

// Some brands are automatically supported out of box.
const facebook = new ZBrandBuilder().facebook().build();
const x = new ZBrandBuilder().twitter().build();
const instagram = new ZBrandBuilder().instagram().build();
```

If you need a list of all supported brands in an array, you can retrieve one by just importing the ZBrands array.

```ts
import { ZBrands } from '@zthun/helpful-brands';

// Contains all brands that are supported out of the box by the ZBrandBuilder()
// The actual array ZBrands, is frozen and immutable so you won't be able
// to change anything in it.  If you need a mutable array, you must slice the
// ZBrands array.
const brands = ZBrands.slice();
```
