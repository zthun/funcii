# Helpful Node

There are some methods that the node api does not supply that are useful to
have. This package supplies them.

This package is ONLY meant to be used by node and not browsers as methods and
extensions found in this package include potential system access that browsers
do not have permission to do, unlike @zthun/helpful-fn, where methods are
supported on both node apps and browsers.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @zthun/helpful-node
yarn add @zthun/helpful-node
```
